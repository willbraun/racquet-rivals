					>Paddle</a
				>, our payment processor and Merchant of Record.
			</p>

			<h2 class="mb-4 mt-8 text-3xl font-bold">1. Annual Subscriptions</h2>
			<p class="mb-2 text-xl">
				You may cancel your subscription at any time through your account settings. Upon
				cancellation:
			</p>
			<ul class="mb-2 list-disc pl-8 text-xl">
				<li>
					You will continue to have access to all subscription features until the end of your
					current billing period.
				</li>
				<li>Your subscription will not automatically renew for the next billing period.</li>
				<li>
					No partial refunds are provided for the unused portion of your current subscription
					period.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="mb-2 text-xl">
				Refund requests for annual subscriptions will be considered under the following
				circumstances:
			</p>
			<ul class="mb-2 list-disc pl-8 text-xl">
				<li>Request submitted within 7 days of initial purchase or renewal</li>
				<li>
					Technical issues that prevent you from accessing subscription features for an extended
					period
				</li>

				<li>Your refund request is submitted prior to the draw's prediction deadline</li>
				<li>You have not made predictions for the draw</li>

				Once predictions are closed or you have submitted predictions, individual draw purchases
				become non-refundable as the service has been provided.
