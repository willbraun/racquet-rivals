				Welcome! Racquet Rivals is a platform for tennis fans to compete against each other in a fun
				and friendly environment. <br /><br />We follow the four major professional tennis
				tournaments (Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, and US Open) for men's and women's
				singles. Once the Round of 16 is set, you'll predict the winners of the remaining matches in
				the draw, like a March Madness bracket. If your players win, you'll gain points and move up
				the leaderboard!
